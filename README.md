# Extract Exports Using Babel

This is a fork of the NextJS [SSG transform Babel plugin](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/5544adc481f8821567e947a6e6d51d9d68ebd367/packages/next/build/babel/plugins/next-ssg-transform.ts) that cleans up the plugin to further understand how it works while also adding support for tracking TypeScript type declarations.
